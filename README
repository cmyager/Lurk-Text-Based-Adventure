CHROM, FIGHT, or MESSG or the 5 letter work for the extensions

--HOW TO--
I made it for localhost currently.
have the server and client in the same folder (the server makes a file so the client knows the port
( I kept having to type new ports so I made a work around )
run the client (unicurses is required)
or you can change the port and domain which is at the top, but I think the auto select one is pretty cool!
